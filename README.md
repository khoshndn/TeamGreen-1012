•Images of popular places to visit•


We have decided to do the Mini-Database project for images. The main topic of our project is going to be focused on popular vacation spots in each continent. The user would input the country they would like to visit (e.g. Canada), then the server will display images of popular places to visit in that country on the display area, divided into 4 sections. We will also have an index section on the webpage where the user can see all the countries available to search on the database. There will also be a weathers report section where you can check the live weather data.
